    <h3>Media Query</h3>
    <p class="par">
      This week I learned about media queries and why they are very useful in
      creating responsive websites. Media Queries help others with disabilities
      who may be able to see the screen. For instance, for people who have
      motion sickness they may be sensitive to certain animations. Media queries
      allow them to still access the content without seeing the animations that
      are embedded.
    </p>
    <p class="par">
      Another aspect of media queries that I touched on was learning the
      different media types and features. I was interested in seeing that they
      had a maximum for different viewports, ratios, resolution, etc. Learning
      these types of features is pretty cool and useful for further projects
      that I will be working on.
