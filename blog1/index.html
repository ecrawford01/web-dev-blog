    <h3>Part One</h3>
    <p class="par">
      First and foremost, I learned about the differenc between HTML and CSS.
      HTML plays the structural role as it is used to put certain content into a
      certain tag. On the other end, CSS helps style the page to make the page
      look nice. A good analogy to use is that HTML is the physical body type of
      a person while the CSS could be thought of as either the clothes and
      accessories or their personality. JavaScript helps add the functionality
      of the page. Going back to the analogy, I would say that JavaScript are
      the actions that a person would do, like a verb.

      Here is an exmaple of some basic CSS code to change the background color
      of a page to light blue.
    </p>
    <code>body { background-color: lightblue; }</code>

      On another note, I also learned about the difference between client and
      servers. I was aware that servers are supposed to serve the clients but I
      did not know how it was done. I was surprised to find out that servers use
      multiple "doors" using different port numbers. I touched on ports a little
      bit in CS361 but I never had a complete grasp on the subject. Along with
      this, I learned what HTTP is actually used for. Growing up I wondered what
      the difference was between HTTP and HTTPS. Now understanding that the S in
      HTTPS just means secure.
    </p>
    <p>Here is an example of a basic HTTP message.</p>
    <code>GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\n
      <br>
      Host: twodee.org\r\n
      \r\n</code>
