    <h3>How would I teach CS347</h3>
    <p class="par">
      If I was to teach CS347, I think the material I would teach would still
      relate to the material we learned during this semester. However, I would
      not teach this class as a crash course. Learning Web Development in a
      crash course does not really teach you much. A crash course throws
      information at you and expects you to figure out the pieces that you do
      not quite understand. With that being said, I would provide a lecture on
      one of the class days and a lab on the other class day to go over the
      lecture that we had earlier in the week. My course would start by learning
      the basics of web development like HTML and CSS. Following HTML and CSS, I
      would spend about a week or two learning version control with Git and
      Github. I would end this section of the course with a basic HTML and CSS
      website and using version control to keep progress of the project. Once
      that section is complete, the class would move on to learning JavaScript.

    <p class="par">
      I believe that JavaScript is one of the most important things to learn in
      Web Development. So, our class would spend around three to four weeks
      learning the basics of JavaScript and how to integrate JavaScript into Web
      Development. Integration would include learning how to use Node.js,
      Express and React. However Node.js and Express would get taught first so
      that the students gain some insight about to to create a service. Once I
      feel that the students have wrapped their heads around JavaScript, they
      would then create a project to showcase their basic knowledge of
      JavaScript. Following that, they would move to SQL to actually create and
      show databases. We would learn how to create a backend database and have
      the tables appear on the website. Students
