    <h3>Part One</h3>
    <p class="par">
      This article gave a brief idea of what a career path in web development
      would look like. One thing I learned about was the difference between a
      Web Developer and a Software Engineer. I learned that the Web Developers
      work with the style and functionality of websites whereas Software
      Engineers create software applications. Besides the basic definition I did
      not know Web Developers made less than Software Engineers. I was also
      interested in the different roles that developers can grow into such as a
      Technical Director or CTO. Finally, I learned that developers need to know
      more than just program. They need to be team players and be creative.

    <h3>Part Two</h3>
    <p class="par">
      For this part, I decided to learn a little about React and what is does. I
      learned that React is not a language itself but a libray extended from
      JavaScript. It uses an extension from JavaScript's syntax which is called
      JSX. I found React pretty intimidating before reading this article. I have
      some experience with Node.js and I want to learn another extension of
      JavaScript to build off of. One other thing I learned about React is that
      React is not just used to build websites but can build other applications
      such as mobile and virtual.

    <p>Here is an example of a basic Hello World.</p>
    <div class="code">
      <code
        >class App extends React.Component {
        <br />
        &nbsprender() {
        <br />
        &nbsp&nbspreturn &lthr&gtHello world!&lt/hr&gt
        <br />
        &nbsp}
        <br />
        }</code
      >
    </div>
    <br />
