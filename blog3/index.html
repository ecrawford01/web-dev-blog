    <h3>Flexbox</h3>
    <p class="par">
      Over the past week I got to learn more about Flexbox and how to use it.
      Flexbox is a great tool to use to help layout the different divs that I
      use. It is extremely helpful to line up divs and spans either as a row,
      column, or somewhere in between. The labs this week helped me pratice with
      it by making some basic static sites. This tool is extremely useful
      because it helps with not having to rely on hardcoding the values of the
      certain element.

          &nbspdisplay: flex;

          &nbspflex-direction: row;

    <h3>Frontend to Backend</h3>
    <p class="par">
      Another aspect of web development that I learned about was connecting the
      frontend to the backend. Coming to school that was the most interesting
      subject to me that related to Computer Science. When I first heard about
      connecting them it sounded like a foreign language. I was nervous about
      learning alot of languages but once I learned one pretty complicated one
      (Java) it was alot easier to understand the syntax of others. Realizing
      that JavaScript is extremely useful in web development excites me because
      it can be used on the frontend and the backend.

    <p>Here is an example of a basic Hello World.</p>
    <div class="code">
      <code
        >class App extends React.Component {
        <br />
        &nbsprender() {
        <br />
        &nbsp&nbspreturn &lthr&gtHello world!&lt/hr&gt
        <br />
        &nbsp}
        <br />
        }</code
      >
    </div>
